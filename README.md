# Magic trick!
This is a simple magic trick to impress your friends with. It only requires you to memorize the color pallet consisting of 11 colors.

Move your mouse to flip the card and change its color. Right click to change helper mode. 1st mode - invisible, 2nd mode - color stripes, 3rd mode - color borders.

Let your friend name a color and then just move your mouse around like you're doing something. Then, stop your mouse on the selected color and flip the card. Boom! Your friend is confused and wants you to do this again.
